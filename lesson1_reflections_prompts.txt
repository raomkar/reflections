How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

super easy , easy-peasy , sometimes I get confused regarding what was addes and what was deleted. I will there was a colour annotating that too. 



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

helps organize my thoughts and experiments in isolated silos 
try different algorithms in separate git commits
